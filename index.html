				After a long day of hacking we love to just collapse on the couch and watch some Netflix. But it is always such a struggle to find good movies on Netflix unless you spend an hour browsing through their content and persistently checking back and forth between IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Netflix. So we set out to solve this problem to save ourselves and others from the frustration.
			</p>
			<p>
				We made a search engine that collects data from Netflix, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes, and presents it in a neat little all-inclusive package. But this wasn't enough for us! We wanted to make searching for content easier as well and so we built a "smart-search". Essentially, you can make complex queries to reflect what kind of movies you are in the mood for. For example, you can type in "Movies with Ryan Gosling after 2005 and rated higher than 7.0 on IMDb". It doesn't have to be that complex of course! You can always just browse and sort the content by different variables.

						From the first moment I laid my hands on my DSLR camera I have fallen in love with photography. There is something special about capturing precious moments. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I built this website for two reasons: I wanted to escape the limitaton of templates when showcasing my photos and I wanted to learn how to build a jQuery carousel from scratch. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I looked at tons of jQuery slideshows and noted elements I liked and disliked. In the end, I came up with a new design that I felt would work well for my purpose. 
					</p>
					<p>
						What I did
						<ul>
							<li>developed minimalist design concept using a pencil and paper approach</li>
							<li>developed the website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript</li>
							<li>learned and utilized jQuery</li>
							<li>implemented complex functions such as "infinite scroll"</li>

						St. Emeric Hungarian School is designed to help children hold onto their heritage by teaching language arts and culture.

						I worked at the school for a year teaching preschoolers basic language skills through games. I had a great experience working there.

						The principal of the school approached me and asked if I could design a new logo for the school and I was more than happy to do so. The only guideline I received was to incorporate an animal, so I chose to work with owls.
					</p>
					<p>
						What I did
						<ul>
							<li>worked with another designer to develop the initial concept</li>
							<li>used pencil drawing as a reference and drew the design in Adobe Illustrator</li>
							<li>used a warm pastel colour palette to reflect the happy environment of the school</li>

						Students at the University of Waterloo have created groups on facebook to buy and sell textbooks, offer and look for rides, and sublet apartments or houses. However, it is impossible to find relevant information on facebook due to the nature of the facebook feed.

						In the spring of 2014 I had the idea to create a website to organize the information in order to help students find books, rides, or places to live more easily.
